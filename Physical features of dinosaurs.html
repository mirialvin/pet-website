    <h1><b>Physical features of dinasoures.</b></h1>
    <p>Dinosaurs were land animals that lived in almost all parts of the world, from tropical regions to deserts. They came in many different sizes and had different body shapes. Some were huge creatures, up to 40 meters long and a hundred tons in weight. Others were as small as a chicken.</p>
    <p>Most dinosaurs had a scaly skin with no hair on their bodies. Although we often think dinosaurs were grey, dull creatures, experts think that some of them could have been really colorful.</p>
    <p>Until today scientists donâ€™t really know if dinosaurs were cold- or warm-blooded animals. They had their own way of regulating their body temperature.</p>
    <p>Some dinosaurs were able to walk on their two hind legs and stood upright. They had hollow, light bones which enabled them to move quickly. Others had strong bones to support their massive weight. They moved slowly on all four legs.</p>
    <h2><b>Why dinosaurs died out</b></h2>
    <p>Dinosaurs became extinct towards the end of the Mesozoic era, about 65 million years ago. </p>
    <p>Although there are still some mysteries left most scientists think that a drastic change in climate killed them. Winters became too cold for dinosaurs to survive. Another theory says that a huge asteroid hit the Earth at that time. It whirled so much dust and gas into the atmosphere that sunlight was blocked out for millions of years. Dinosaurs probably starved to death because there was no food.</p>
